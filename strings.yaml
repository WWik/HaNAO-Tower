  congratulations:
    - ["Very nice! The game was completed with {num_moves} moves. \\pau=400\\" , 1]
  explanation: 
     - ["Let me explain how the game works. \\pau=200\\
        One player can only move one disk at a time between the poles. \\pau=400\\
        Bigger disks are not allowed on top of smaller ones. \\pau=400\\
        The game starts after all the disks are stacked on your left side, \\pau=800\\ ordered by size from big to small.\\pau=600\\
        I will ask you to move the disks for me. \\pau=400\\
        The goal is to move all the disks to the right pole.",
