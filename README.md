# HaNAO 

## What it does
You will see your NAO indicating you how to solve the Hanoi Tower with X disks (X from 1 to 5).

## Schedule
 - Implementing the Breadth First Search (DONE)
 - Implementing the STRIPS Planning Algorithm (DONE)
 - Comparing the two algorithm (DONE)

## Requirements
The project runs on python 2.7.18 and you will have to install naoqi, [pyddl](https://github.com/garydoranjr/pyddl) and numpy for it to work.

## Installation
To run this program, you have to install the animations found in the folder _Animations_ (a Choreograph project) and store the updated posture library on NAO. 
You can find information how to install the custom animations here: [Custom Animations on NAO](https://sebastianwallkoetter.wordpress.com/2019/05/19/custom-animations-during-speech/). 
You can find information on how to install custom poses here: [Custom Poses on NAO](https://sebastianwallkoetter.wordpress.com/2019/04/05/the-hidden-potential-of-nao-and-pepper-custom-robot-postures-in-naoqi-v2-4/)

After this step, you can start the module via

    play_game.py <robot_ip>
 
#### Algorithm supports (currently) from 1 to 5 disks on the first game's pole

#### If you have any questions or encounter any trouble, feel free to create an issue on this GitHub.
